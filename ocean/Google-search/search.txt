Examples:


1.	red and blue and green..the query should be like red blue green (removing and, in,etc)

2. Using Truncation

	--> you’ll get results for the word combination you’ve keyed in, with * as variant. For example, if you type in cartoon * tutorials, you will get sites with the phrase “Cartoon Character Illustration Tutorials”, “Cartoon Coloring Tutorial”, “Cartoon Animation Tutorial”, etc.

	--> color web design, and the results will show sites or its posts that are related with the query “color web design”, such as “Warm VS Cool Color Website Designs”, “Beautiful Purple Color Website Designs”, “Stunning Blue Color Website Designs”, etc.


3.	Exact Phrases
	--> if you want to find out who quoted “The unexamined life is not worth living”, then it is preferable that you type the whole line rather than putting in keywords like “unexamined” or “living“.

	-->Quotation marks, ” “, should ideally be used if you want the search engine to only look for sites with exact phrasing.

	-->combination of exact phrases and keywords to enhance your search. For example, you might want to search for sites that provide useful tips on leveraging social media for your business. Rather than using three keywords: “social”, “media” and “business”, you can type in “social media” business in the form and get more accurate results.

4.	The minus sign,–, is useful if you wish to exclude a particular word or phrase in your search. This is valuable when you are searching for exception to what search results would typically produce.example.

	-->you wish to search for someone with the name “Bill Gates”, but not the chairman of Microsoft who we are all familiar with. You know that sites with the name “Bill Gates” would usually come with “Microsoft”, so using the – sign like “bill gates” -microsoft would bring you close to what you really want to find.

	
5. Using "OR"

	-->This means to say that if you put “social media” OR “business”, you will get sites that consists of either “social media” or “business”, and not any of the three words per se.

6.	~ operator

	-->The tilde tells Google to search for pages that are synonyms or similar to the term that follows.

	[ ~inexpensive ] matches “inexpensive,” “cheap,” “affordable,” and “low cost”
	[ ~run ] matches “run,” “runner’s,” “running,” as well as “marathon”

7. .. operator

	-->Specify that results contain numbers in a range by specifying two numbers, separated by two periods, with no spaces.

	For example, specify that you are searching in the price range $250 to $1000 using the number range specification $250..$1000.

	[ recumbent bicycle $250..$1000 ]
