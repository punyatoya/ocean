DEQUEUE



Double-ended-queue is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue
 ---->for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).


Dequeue has sub-types:

 	*An input-restricted deque is one where deletion can be made from both ends, but insertion can be made at one end only.
	*An output-restricted deque is one where insertion can be made at both ends, but deletion can be made from one end only.

The basic operations on a deque are enqueue and dequeue on either end

	*insert element at back
	*insert element at front
	*remove last element
	*remove first element
	*examine first element
	*examine last element


Applications of Dequeue:

	*Palindrome checker

	*A-Steal job scheduling Algorithm

		-->implements the task scheduling for multiple processors.
		-->the processor gets the first element from the dequeue.
		-->when one of the processor completes execution of its own threads it can steal a thread from  another processor.
		-->It gets the last from the dequeue of another processor and executes it.

	*Undo-Redo operations in Software Applications.s
