STACK


Stack is a linear data-structure

A stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added.


A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack

Stacks have some useful terminology associated with them:
Push--> To add an element to the stack
Pop --->To remove an element from the STOCK
Peek--> To look at elements in the stack without removing them
LIFO---> Refers to the last in, first out behavior of the stack




A typical Stack implementation supports 3 operations:
-----------------------------------------------------------
 Push(), Pop(), and Top().

Push() will add an item to the end of the list. This takes constant time.
Pop() will remove the item at the end of the list. This takes constant time.
Top() will return the value of the item at the top.


Some of the applications of stacks are

-->Implementation the function calls
-->Maintaining the UNDO list for an application
-->Checking the nesting of parentheses in an expression
-->Evaluating the expression
