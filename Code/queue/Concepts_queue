	4. Operations
		4.1 Enqueue

Queue is also an abstract data type or a linear data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end called REAR(also called tail), and the deletion of exisiting element takes place from the other end called as FRONT(also called head). This makes queue as FIFO data structure, which means that element inserted first will also be removed first.

The process to add an element into queue is called Enqueue and the process of removal of an element from queue is called Dequeue.



It is a FIFO structure


Applications of Queue

Queue, as the name suggests is used whenever we need to have any group of objects in an order in which the first one coming in, also gets out first while the others wait for there turn, like in the following scenarios :

Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer, CPU task scheduling etc.
In real life, Call Center phone systems will use Queues, to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.
Handling of interrupts in real-time systems. The interrupts are handled in the same order as they arrive, First come first served.
