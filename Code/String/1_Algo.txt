First Approach 


Time complexity=O(n)



Algorithm

	*Create a character count array

		--->The size of array will be 256 for English characters.

		--->The character count array will contain the no. of times 		particular character appears in the string.

		example if the input string is "aacccddddb"
		count['a']=2
		count['b']=1
		count['c']=3
		count['d']=4

		--->To get the above count array iterate through the characters of string putting the condition if the character matches the index of the array thereby incrementing the count whenever it finds the character more than 1.


	*Scan the count array and print the character for which count is max.
